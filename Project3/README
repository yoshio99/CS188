CS188 Final Project

Introduction:

As one of California’s fastest growing FreightTech companies, NEXT is on a mission to make freight
painless. Through complete first-to-last mile solutions, we’re defining how FreightTech can transform
the $800B trucking and shipping industry. From our digital freight marketplace to smart load-matching,
our technology provides shippers with access to limitless capacity and full transparency, while
empowering drivers to work the way they want, when they want.

As we build the most trusted brand for our customers, we are creating the best place to work for our
growing team of top talent from the tech and logistics industries. We have been recognized as one of
Built in LA’s Best Small Companies to Work For and 50 Startups to Watch.

Founded in 2015, NEXT Trucking is backed by Brookfield Ventures, one of the world’s largest
infrastructure investors, and Sequoia Capital, one of the most recognizable venture capital firms in the
world.

Challenge:

NEXT Trucking is interested in better understanding the drivers in its network. The ultimate goal is to
both build a predictive model capable of determining overall network capacity to handle incoming
shipping requests as well as more effectively recruit high-performing drivers to enhance their network.
As a first step, they are interested in developing a classification model to better determine whether or
not a driver will be a high-performing one.

You and your team (yes you will be allowed to work in groups!), will serve as consultants to NEXT
Trucking. You will be asked to develop a predictive model for this task and report out your findings to
them.
