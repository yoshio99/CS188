Project Description:

For this first project we will introduce you to the end-to-end process of doing a datascience project. Our goals for this project are to:

Familiarize you with the development environment for doing datascience
Get you comfortable with the python coding required to do datascience
Provide you with an sample end-to-end project to help you visualize the steps needed to complete a project on your own
Ask you to recreate a similar project on a separate dataset
In this project you will work through an example project end to end. Many of the concepts you will encounter will be unclear to you. That is OK! The course is designed to teach you
these concepts in further detail. For now our focus is simply on having you replicate the code successfully and seeing a project through from start to finish.

Here are the main steps:

Get the data
Visualize the data for insights
Preprocess the data for your machine learning algorithm
Select a model and train
Does it meet the requirements? Fine tune the model
