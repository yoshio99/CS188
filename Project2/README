CS188 Project 2 - Binary Classification Comparative Methods
For this project we're going to attempt a binary classification of a dataset using multiple methods and compare results.

Our goals for this project will be to introduce you to several of the most common classification techniques, how to perform them and tweek parameters to optimize outcomes, how to 
produce and interpret results, and compare performance. You will be asked to analyze your findings and provide explanations for observed performance.

Specifically you will be asked to classify whether a patient is suffering from heart disease based on a host of potential medical factors.

DEFINITIONS

Binary Classification: In this case a complex dataset has an added 'target' label with one of two options. Your learning algorithm will try to assign one of these labels to the data.

Supervised Learning: This data is fully supervised, which means it's been fully labeled and we can trust the veracity of the labeling.

Background: The Dataset
For this exercise we will be using a subset of the UCI Heart Disease dataset, leveraging the fourteen most commonly used attributes. All identifying information about the patient has been scrubbed.

The dataset includes 14 columns. The information provided by each column is as follows:

age: Age in years
sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (0 = asymptomatic; 1 = atypical angina; 2 = non-anginal pain; 3 = typical angina)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
cholserum: Cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0= showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria; 1 = normal; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV))
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeakST: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = downsloping; 1 = flat; 2 = upsloping)
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
Sick: Indicates the presence of Heart disease (True = Disease; False = No disease)
